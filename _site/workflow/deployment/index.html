<p>A disaster of sufficient magnitude and humanitarian impact, with a request for assistance from a NetHope partner, will result in the deployment of a small contingent from NetHope’s Emergency Response Team. These staff carry out a two-fold mission: conducting needs assessments through consultations with government, partner NGOs, and affected communities; and providing NetHope’s core competency by improving connectivity in any way possible. To this end the initial deployment team brings as much equipment with them as is practicable, in order to address any urgent communications needs identified by in-country stakeholders.</p>

<p>Needs assessments are carried out as outlined in the below section, in concert with remote assessments by the Crisis Informatics team. Even while working to improve connectivity and create a facilitating environment for response by all agencies, NetHope staff must be prepared to conduct their initial data gathering with little or no connectivity and no access to online tools. The basic elements of information management, including the cleaning of field data, are often carried out on the fly. For example, lists of sites that require connectivity will flow in from numerous different agencies and it is rare that a standard format for this information will be applied. Locations may be vaguely defined, and the names and spellings of place names may be inconsistent and difficult to reconcile. If they are provided, geographic coordinates may be incorrect or inaccurate, or provided in different formats or coordinate systems.</p>

<p>Sound information management practices must also be applied to track the inventory of equipment that is distributed, the terms and intended duration of its deployment, and responsible points of contact. Ongoing monitoring is required to ensure that equipment and relevant services continue to function properly.</p>

<p>When a disaster occurs, data preparedness needs to quickly crystalize into information products for people who are deploying into theatre. Regardless of sector, an organization sending a team into a disaster zone requires data and information to plan and guide daily work. These materials are sometimes built into a briefing book or atlas, so that key information is contained in one resource.</p>

<h3 id="field-atlas">Field Atlas</h3>
<p>A set of information resources that can be taken on the plane, read, and used entirely offline. Paper is often best.</p>

<p>Getting gear into country is rarely as simple as packing Pelican cases and putting them on a commercial flight. Specialized satellite communication equipment can be bulky and heavy, and networking gear to service dozens of sites may take up substantial volume. Many NGOs (including NetHope) preposition some gear at humanitarian logistics depots in regional offices of the UN. Information managers need to work with logisticians to track this gear from warehouse to deployment sites; this gear needs either to be returned to the warehouse, or it requires a set of documents around a formal handoff to a local organization (due to donor requirements around their own inventory).</p>

<p>In near parallel to the data scramble phase, and sometimes before a formal decision to deploy is made, the pre-deployment process of mobilization begins. Logistical and travel arrangements must be made. Staff who are likely to deploy begin to pack and determine what technical equipment can be taken with them. Pro forma invoices and other documents are produced in order to expedite passage through customs, and to allow for transfer to partners on the ground, if necessary. NetHope staff also require an organizational sponsor – usually a partner NGO – in order to obtain the proper visas and permission to operate in a foreign country. Staff also need to establish who their initial points of contact will be on the ground.</p>
