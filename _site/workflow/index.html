<p>NGOs working through NetHope would benefit from having an information management workflow that extends the UN’s Coordinated Data Scramble, adding in the data sharing agreements that NGOs have established with private sector entities. These include geospatial datasets from satellite firms; subscriber data from networking and mobile network operators as well as social media companies like Facebook (via its Disaster Maps program); and subscription-based data about specific elements of country infrastructure, such as the Budde Reports. This document captures the preliminary sketch of one such workflow.</p>

<p>It begins by defining the set of problems that this workflow attempts to solve; then continues through the activities within that workflow with a) data sets necessary to drive decisions around those activities, b) data sharing agreements necessary to obtain those data sets, and c) methods for analyzing those data sets, some of which remain under non-disclosure agreement because of the nature of the data sharing agreements.</p>

<h3 id="defining-the-audience">Defining the Audience</h3>
<p>Each disaster creates a unique political structure around decision making. Even when the same type of natural hazard occurs in the same country, the politics of information management will vary, in part because different people will occupy key roles, both on the side the host-nation government as well as the international organizations and NGOs that respond. For this reason, it is critical to define the audience for information products as one of the first steps in a workflow.</p>

<p>A single workflow can address a limited set of use cases for specific audiences, else it becomes too complicated for anyone to follow. The challenge within humanitarian action is that information managers need to address a range of analytical questions that vary according both the nature and context of the operation, as well as the political structure of the response.</p>

<p>One of the best existing maps of the decision makers in humanitarian operations comes from OCHA’s work with the Digital Humanitarian Network. This Decision Makers Taxonomy shows the various branches of stakeholders who have a voice in the decisions being made in the early phase of a response operation:</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-structure-of-the-response">Understanding the Structure of the Response</h3>

<p>The political structure of an international response operation defines the working space for information managers. If the response will coordinated by the Cluster system, the information flows will be fundamentally different than working in a bilateral operation with the host nation government. It is here important to state that, under UN General Assembly Resolution 46/182, “national authorities have the primary responsibility for taking care of victims of natural disasters and other emergencies that occur in their territory.” (IASC Cluster Reference Model 2015). When an emergency overwhelms national capacities, the hosting national authorities can request international assistance. International organizations and NGOs generally only respond to disasters when their aid is specifically requested.</p>

<p>To help scope the type of assets to be deployed, international organizations have used a three-step classification of disasters:</p>

<p><strong>L1 Emergency</strong>: any emergency in a country where a UN agency has a presence.</p>

<p><strong>L2 Emergency</strong>: any emergency which overwhelms in-country capacities and requires mobilization of regional support.</p>

<p><strong>L3 Emergency</strong>: either an emergency which overwhelms a specific UN agency’s regional capacity, or an emergency where the urgency, scale and complexity merit a UN system-wide response.</p>

<p>This work take several forms, each of which branches off into its own decision-making structures, workflows, and information needs.</p>

<p><strong>Bilateral Agreements</strong>: A hosting national authority may establish a relationship with another government, international agency, or NGO to provide specific services during a response operation. This may to send specific technical assistance (such as urban search and rescue, UNDAC teams, mortuary teams, telecommunications experts, etc) or it may to extend existing programming from one area of the contract into the affected areas.</p>

<p><strong>Regional Disaster Management Agreements</strong>: an association of national disaster management authorities that delegates specific functions to a regional disaster management authority. These include ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (aka, AHA Centre) and CDEMA. The capacity of these regional authorities has changed from a coordinating body to an operational capacity, as evidenced by the delegation of coordination and information management functions to ASEAN during the recent tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia. (links)</p>

<p><strong>IASC Cluster System</strong>: The Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) provides a framework for UN agencies, NGOs, government development agencies, and some private-sector companies to participate in a voluntary coordinating structure that is intended to integrate with host government procedures. The IASC cluster systems provides coordination across 12 areas: (diagram). (link)</p>

<h3 id="impact-of-response-structure-on-information-management">Impact of Response Structure on Information Management</h3>
<p>Interviewees made clear that they have not built standard operating procedures in part because each disaster response operation is unique: information managers will take different approaches to workflows depending on the political structure of the response, as well as who tends to respond at different operational classifications (L1, L2, L3). Each disaster also has unique impacts on a society, depending on the specific regions most impacted, who lives there, their relative political position and ability to get resources, etc. The number of permutations has created an approach of building checklists instead standard operating procedures (SOP). Only one NGO stated that they have an SOP; all others indicated a checklist approach.</p>
