# Research

In the process of interviewing experts in the humanitarian information management cycle, we repeatedly observed that the gap between the potential analyses that current data science techniques make possible and their current use within the humanitarian system. Senior leaders in humanitarian action rarely have backgrounds that enable them to understand data science; they tend to be hired from the political class. While they may be able to read a financial spreadsheet, their capacity to understand complex interrelationships between delays in medical logistics, the linked increase probability of disease outbreaks, and the potential disproportionate effect on children under five is best put into narrative form; their capacity to interpret and ask questions of mathematical models (such a geospatial statistics showing specifically where this risk has increased) is limited (at best).

Information managers are frequently placed in a position of translating between data science, humanitarian experts in specific sectors (health, water, shelter, etc), and senior management. This position mirrors the situation that Chief Information Managers faced in the early dot-com era, when they were asked to take a seat on the corporate board of directors and explain the Web to business leaders with no technology background beyond basic reports.





## Key Findings

### Checklists Over Standard Operating Procedures
Interviewees emphasized that every response is different and unique, and retaining an element of flexibility is paramount.
International Federational of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has a voluntary confederation of information managers from its member societies that provide Surge Informational Management Support.

The vast majority of interviewees report that they do not adhere to standard operating procedures during the first hours of a response. For information managers, a range of templates and checklists are reported as being used, but respondents stress that every response is different and unique, and retaining an element of flexibility is paramount. Where SOPs do exist, they are generally employed as a reference or suggested guidance, and not operationalized in rigid form.  RC and UN have IM checklists. CDS and SIMS. No parallel shared among NGOs. No standardized workflow across the sector.

### Decisions are driven by politics and rules of thumb rather than data and evidence
A common refrain is that even as increasing amounts and new sources of data become available and accessible in the earliest phases of disaster response, there remains a gap for decision makers at the highest levels to use this information. In part this is due to the self-conscious recognition that many early decisions are driven by the realities of politics and perception, and that press reporting - accurate or not - continues to have undue weight. Another reason for the gap is that organizations can lack the technical expertise and internal mechanisms to synthesize and simplify complex information, and provide key findings to busy senior managers. 

In spite of this gap, organizations are continuing to make strides in integrating new sources of information, and implementing technical solutions to allow data to flow to and from the field. While the earliest decisions might still be made in a context of little or bad data, sophisticated analysis and information management is moving further and further upstream and up the chain of command.
