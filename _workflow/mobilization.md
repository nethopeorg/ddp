## Mobilization
{%- include workflow_nav.html -%}

In near parallel to the data scramble phase, and sometimes before a formal decision to deploy is made, the pre-deployment process of mobilization begins. Logistical and travel arrangements must be made. Staff who are likely to deploy begin to pack and determine what technical equipment can be taken with them. Pro forma invoices and other documents are produced in order to expedite passage through customs, and to allow for transfer to partners on the ground, if necessary. NetHope staff also require an organizational sponsor – usually a partner NGO – in order to obtain the proper visas and permission to operate in a foreign country. Staff also need to establish who their initial points of contact will be on the ground.
