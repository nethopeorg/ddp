# Workflow for NGO Information Managers
## Deployment
{%- include workflow_nav.html -%}

The NetHope Field Operations team deploys to crises where the provision of temporary connectivity would serve members and the affected population. In addition, NetHope has been partnering with organizations like Internews and Facebook to provide information as aid. Mobilizing a team from multiple countries to deploy to a disaster zone with hundreds of thousands of USD of networking equipment is a specialized task requiring specific information and data. As part of this data preparedness project, NetHope devised the following workflow to handle these information products.

This work may happen in parallel with the data scramble phase. This is critical because logistical and travel arrangements must be made as quickly as possible. Staff who are likely to deploy begin to pack and determine what technical equipment can be taken with them. Pro forma invoices and other documents are produced in order to expedite passage through customs, and to allow for transfer to partners on the ground, if necessary. NetHope staff also require an organizational sponsor – usually a partner NGO – in order to obtain the proper visas and permission to operate in a foreign country. Staff also need to establish who their initial points of contact will be on the ground.

### Team Mission and Composition
NetHope will deploy trained teams who have experience working in disaster situations and are familiar with the international and national systems for managing emergencies. These staff carry out a two-fold mission: conducting needs assessments through consultations with government, partner NGOs, and affected communities; and providing connectivity through the installation of networks, including backhaul that connects to terrestrial or satellite providers. Frequently, these teams include personnel from technical partners such as Ericsson and Cisco (and in 2018, NetHope trained teams from Amazon, Facebook, and Google). These teams include experts in the installation of networks, the connection of the those networks to mobile network operators, establishment of long-range WiFi shots, and deployment of satellite communications gear. These teams bring individuals who can coordinate work with the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster. They also bring as much equipment with them as is practicable, in order to address any urgent communications needs identified by in-country stakeholders.

### Team Information requirements
Mobilizing and deploying a team to a crisis requires providing simple, practical information products that answer specific questions. In interviewing multiple deployment teams, these questions center on the following areas:

#### Scope and Extent of emergency
The questions, "how big? how bad?" often flow from a responder's mouth as one inquiry. In the initial hours of a major crisis, it can be difficult to ascertain the answers. Communications may be down. Satellites may not be schedule to pass over for many hours; or cloud cover from a storm may make the initial imagery useless. Deployment teams like to know as much as possible about the magnitude, scope, and specific geographic extent of a crisis, as it will change their choices of equipment or even team composition.

#### Building/Settlement Layer
Understanding who is affected and how is a key element of a response. NetHope has devoted time to beginning to aggregate information about electrical and telecommunications grids and relating them to building and settlement layers. This work will continue for years.

#### Telecommunications Network
Knowing where networks are is only half of the equation. It is imperative to know how access to telecommunications coverage has changed and who is affected.

#### Telecommunications Equipment
What standards are used in country, from voltages and frequencies to specific gear.

#### Geography and Topology


#### Who is doing what where
members who are already working in the country who can sponsor visas and aid with customs, security, transport, housing, etc.


#### Contacts

#### Fundraising


#### Customs and visas

### Briefing Book/Field Atlas
When mobilizing a team to deploy, most individual effort is devoted to packing gear and planning travel\. The first change many team members will get to understand the nature of the crisis will be on the plane. The briefing book and field atlas serve this purpose. They provide a packaged information product to help the deployment team learn the topology of the place, understand who they need to connect with, and build a basic plan for initial operations. The briefing book has not been a traditional NetHope product, but interviewees emphasized the need for its creation, including NetHope's own team.



### Site Assessments
The needs for sites must be assessed as outlined in the below section, in concert with remote assessments by the Crisis Informatics team. Even while working to improve connectivity and create a facilitating environment for response by all agencies, NetHope staff must be prepared to conduct their initial data gathering with little or no connectivity and no access to online tools. The basic elements of information management, including the cleaning of field data, are often carried out on the fly. For example, lists of sites that require connectivity will flow in from numerous different agencies and it is rare that a standard format for this information will be applied. Locations may be vaguely defined, and the names and spellings of place names may be inconsistent and difficult to reconcile. If they are provided, geographic coordinates may be incorrect or inaccurate, or provided in different formats or coordinate systems.

### Asset Tracking

Getting gear into country is rarely as simple as packing Pelican cases and putting them on a commercial flight. Specialized satellite communication equipment can be bulky and heavy, and networking gear to service dozens of sites may take up substantial volume. Many NGOs (including NetHope) preposition some gear at humanitarian logistics depots in regional offices of the UN. Information managers need to work with logisticians to track this gear from warehouse to deployment sites; this gear needs either to be returned to the warehouse, or it requires a set of documents around a formal handoff to a local organization (due to donor requirements around their own inventory).

#### Who is Doing What Where (3W)
The first official 3W generally takes about three weeks to generate from OCHA. The NetHope Informatics team will contribute to this document and make its contents widely known to the deployment team. {% sidenote 'mn-id-3w' 'The <a href="https://centre.humdata.org/how-the-centre-will-measure-results/">OCHA 3W Process</a> is being improved, but currently takes 20 days.' %}
