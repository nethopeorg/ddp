# Workflow for NGO Information Managers
## Data Preparedness
{%- include workflow_nav.html -%}

Building a repository of useful data requires a network of individuals working together to specify which data sets are necessary to support decisions around the identified use cases. This grant was designed around this process: over the course of 2018, NetHope has interviewed partner companies, member NGOs, and UN agencies and clusters to which NetHope contributes during emergencies. In general, any data preparedness project proceeds by identifying use cases, then identifying the data sets that are required to meeting these use cases. This work proceeds to obtaining and aggregating these data, cleaning them and preparing them for release on some kind of shared resource; this is often a data portal. The case of DDP followed this process.

### Use Case for DDP

Successful data preparedness projects start with a **use case**: a way of scoping an activity so that the data collected during the preparedness phase meets the needs of specific users for a known scenario or challenge. The mantra at the Open Data for Resilience Initiative at the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery is to identify the use case before any work starts on data collection. {% sidenote 'mn-id-opendrifg' 'The <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en/publication/open-data-resilience-initiative-field-guide">OpenDRI Field Guide</a> is available at the GFDRR web site. See Chapter on Scoping.' %} Similarly, the work at OCHA's Centre for Humanitarian Data focuses on building baseline datasets to prepare humanitarian information managers during emergencies.

This DDP project focuses on the use case of humanitarian NGOs that are planning interventions that rely on telecommunications and electrical networks&mdash;a set of activities that include NGO operations, digital cash programming, as well as the use of information as aid. Data preparedness in this context extends into private sector datasets that may have limited distribution or non-disclosure agreements around them; such data include cellular network coverage areas, the density of mobile network subscribers and their movements over time (in aggregate with privacy controls), and social media data, which provide another lens on similar activities of consumers and businesses. The regional focus on this work further limits the use case to the Caribbean region. This area tends to be hit by hurricanes, landslides, and earthquakes.  

Use cases broke into three personas:

#### NetHope Field Team
NetHope has its own Field Operations team which deploys communications and networking equipment to disaster response operations. The team requires specific information so that they can mobilize a team to install equipment at specific sites, usually hosted by NetHope members or local NGOs. These datasets include road maps, maps of mobile data coverage, maps of internet/telecommunications grids, key contacts in telecommunications and member organizations, and a method of tracking what equipment gets installed where for whom.

#### NetHope Member Field Officer
NetHope members may either already be working in the host nation or be authorized to work there (usually with an agreement or license from the government to operate). These members are critical to the NetHope Field Team, as they often serve as sponsors for NetHope interventions as well as visa sponsors for NetHope staff and technical partner personnel. NetHope members tend to require data that identify the magnitude and extent of the natural hazard, who was affected, what aid might be needed, and what other organizations are planning for their interventions.

#### Technical Partner
Companies frequently deploy with NetHope Field Teams and provide analytical support to the NetHope Informatics Team. These entities generally require data to scope their operations, brief their management on the mission, and assess the personal safety and security of personnel headed to a country where many normal services are destroyed or degraded. They require assessments of the need, proposed locations for interventions, assets or equipment required, and details on the logistics of the operation (transportation, lodging, food, security, evacuation, etc.).


### Data Identification
To support the NetHope use case, several types of data sets were deemed important:

**Existing Humanitarian Data** (existing): datasets that are already hosted at sites such as HDX, World Bank, GIS portals, and government open data portals.

**Private Sector Data** (private): data that must be obtained from telecommunications and social media companies (among others) and used under license or other restrictions around its publication and/or distribution, reuse, and combination with other data.

**Links to Dynamic Data** (dynamic): data whose freshness is the key factor around its use, including weather forecasts, earthquake shake maps, flood or tsunami extent polygons, and the like.

**Custom Data** (custom): data that need to be collected for specific purpose, which would include needs assessments as well as data that need to built from many sources into a new dataset (such the frequencies of VHF/HF radio systems in use by UN agencies and host nation civil protection teams in various countries)

The specific data sets necessary include:

<table class="booktabs">
<thead><th>Data</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></thead>
<tr><td>Roads</td><td class="c">Existing</td><td class="l">purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>dataset</td><td class="c">type</td><td class="l">purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>dataset</td><td class="c">type</td><td class="l">purpose</td></tr>
<tr><td>dataset</td><td class="c">type</td><td class="l">purpose</td></tr>
</table>

### Data Collection
Aggregating the identified datasets

### Data Cleansing
Data are rarely in a form that we would like. As the World Bank describes in the Open Data for Resilience Field Guide,

*"Data describe a dynamic reality. Cities are growing at extraordinary rates, with formal and informal settlements sprouting up faster than cartographers can build maps. Alongside this rapid urbanization, hazards are changing in ways that make it far less likely that historical understandings will inform prudent decisions about probable futures. Climate change is altering weather patterns and bringing extreme weather to places that have never seen such variation. Existing stocks of data about a nationâ€™s infrastructure and its relation to natural hazards each need to updated more frequently and at higher resolutions than ever before. In a time of economic hardship and unequal globalization, few governments possess the resources to collate existing data, collect new data, and feed them all into an ecosystem of analysts who can make sense of them so that practitioners can design and implement projects that get ahead of the disaster cycle."* {% sidenote 'mn-id-opendrifg' 'The <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/en/publication/open-data-resilience-initiative-field-guide">OpenDRI Field Guide</a> Executive Summary.' %}

When we are able to obtain data that capture these dynamics, they often need to updated. They almost always need to be put into more standard form, especially data that have been collected in ways which allow for wide variation in the text structures in a field or where geographic information is put into a long narrative paragraph instead of discrete fields that capture the data structure necessary to plot a place on a map.

### Data portals
Several data portals already exist to host humanitarian data. The largest is the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), which contains data sets about most countries in the world. This portal provides both public and private spaces for NGOs and UN agencies to share in data preparedness and operational analysis. The World Bank and GFDRR have created myriad GeoNodes with national governments, primarily to host data about natural hazards and the people and infrastructure exposed to those hazards.

While NetHope could choose to host its own data portal in the future, the needs for its current operation are well met by HDX. Data from this DDP project will be hosted on public and private sites on HDX, except for certain private sector data which must be hosted under terms of the agreement with the corporation.
