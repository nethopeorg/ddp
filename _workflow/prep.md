## Data Preparedness
{%- include workflow_nav.html -%}

Every event is unique. A natural hazard occurs in a complex web of dynamics.

Data are rarely in a form that we would like. As the World Bank describes in the Open Data for Resilience Field Guide,

*"Data describe a dynamic reality. Cities are growing at extraordinary rates, with formal and informal settlements sprouting up faster than cartographers can build maps. Alongside this rapid urbanization, hazards are changing in ways that make it far less likely that historical understandings will inform prudent decisions about probable futures. Climate change is altering weather patterns and bringing extreme weather to places that have never seen such variation. Existing stocks of data about a nationâ€™s infrastructure and its relation to natural hazards each need to updated more frequently and at higher resolutions than ever before. In a time of economic hardship and unequal globalization, few governments possess the resources to collate existing data, collect new data, and feed them all into an ecosystem of analysts who can make sense of them so that practitioners can design and implement projects that get ahead of the disaster cycle."*
