# Workflow for NGO Information Managers
## Initial Assessment
{%- include workflow_nav.html -%}

When a disaster occurs, the NetHope Informatics team uses the data gathered from Preparedness and the Data Scramble to determine the likely impact of a natural hazard. The analysis conducted in this phase determines if NetHope either continues the monitoring process or begins to mobilize a team for a deployment.

It should be noted that interviewees in the research emphasized that standard operating procedures tend to bend toward checklists rather than workflows. NetHope has developed

### 1. Build Initial Situation Report
NetHope Informatics team analyzes information already gathered from the data scramble to assess the impact of the natural hazard on people and infrastructure. Like most humanitarian organizations, NetHope uses issues narrative situation reports to summarize data findings. While these reports often include maps and information graphics, they remain rooted in traditional use of narrative to convey snapshots of the current thinking to decision makers across the NetHope network. Research surfaced a desire to rethink the situation report; a conceptual paper will follow this workflow. (ref future concepts)

NetHope will also open a multi-organizational Slack channel for the emergency to coordinate with partners who are deploying together.

### 2. Liaise with NetHope Members and UN Partners
Depending on the political structure of the response, different elements of the NetHope network may activate.

**For major emergencies** (L3 and some L2), the UN cluster may host calls that pull NGOs together by cluster. NetHope participates in the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC), which is hosted by the World Food Programme (WFP). NetHope will coordinate its activities through ETC as well as through its own membership. NetHope will host conference calls for members to share their response plans. NetHope will also reach out to emergency response directors via email lists. Each day, NetHope will issue a narrative situation report capturing the current understanding of the context, the beginnings of a who is doing what where (3W), and any plans that NetHope has for deploying. The focus of the report will be on member operations and the telecommunications situation.

**For mid-scale emergencies** (L2), NetHope and its member NGOs tends to work through its member structures. The primary mode of coordination will be conference calls for members to share their response plans. NetHope will also reach out to emergency response directors via email lists. NetHope will also ask members to share their situation reports and security briefs. NetHope will issue situation reports in harmony with the tempo of the emergency. For fast-moving situations, it will issue daily reports. For slower emergencies, it will issue reports weekly.

**For low-scale emergencies** (L1), NetHope will monitor the situation using secondary sources and issue reports as necessary. In general, these emergencies get handled at the local level without the need for NetHope deployments.

### 3. Updating information sources
Disasters are highly dynamic. Conditions are likely to have changed in an impacted community since the initial data scramble or since the data was collected and prepared. Crisis Informatics team will conduct a refresh of all previous data pulls and seek additional information sources that confirm or reject news about what conditions are on the ground. This often means a deeper dive into international platforms that have the most-up-to-date information on disaster events, such as: Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, UN OCHA’s Virtual On-Site Operations Coordination Center, and the Global Disaster Alerting Coordination System, and ReliefWeb. In many cases, it may mean collected new data via field teams.

In this step of the process, NetHope Crisis Informatics will often turn to its tech partners, such as Facebook, Google, DigitalGlobe, and GSMA and inquire what their sensors are picking up around an impacted region. This will be done by way of email, phone call, Slack channels, and/or accessing an data sharing portals they may have.

All of the information that is gathered is stored on a Box folder, with specific insights shared informally with NetHope Director of Information Management and Crisis Informatics. The stored data  will later be turned into visuals and infographics for internal and external distribution.

### 4. Liaise with members and international partners who are deploying
In order to coordinate its own Field Operations team, NetHope will reach out to NGO members who have offices and programs in an impacted region and request their internal situation awareness reports to enhance our own understanding. This is done by NetHope Crisis Informatics liaising with NetHope Member Engagement to:

* Identify emergency managers at our member organizations
* Retrieve their contact information
* Draft and send either a group or individual emails to request their situation reports

NetHope will work with OCHA/VOSSOC and the Centre for Humanitarian Data to make datasets (and with permission, points of contacts) available to the Cluster system.

### Information Product List
During each stage, NetHope Crisis Informatics may create one or more maps or informational products that can support and inform decision making throughout the organization and network. These products include:

#### Situation Reports (SitReps)
A narrative document that is emailed to the NetHope team, NetHope NGO members and tech partners, and/or donors, usually in an e-newsletter format. A SitRep would normally include the following sections:

**Summary of the Situation**: A brief overview of the size and scope of the disaster.

**Telecommunication and Power Updates**: Insights from GSMA, UN ETC, and news media on the degradation of power and telecommunications infrastructure.

**NetHope Members**: A list of NetHope NGO members with offices in the country and what their planned/actual response activity for the disaster are.

**Maps and Visuals**: Curation of maps and visuals developed within NetHope or gathered from external information sources.

**Maps and Infographics**: Charts, graphics, and map aids that summarize insights from data will be developed and later compiled into a digital visual book. That book is then emailed to NetHope’s operational team and made available the NetHope’s team for use on other digital platforms.

#### Social Media Bursts
Sample post text and images will be emailed to the NetHope Comms team to share information on our social channels (such as Twitter and NetHope).

#### NetHope and Solution Center Website Updates
Copy and visuals will again be emailed to the NetHope Comms team to publish on NetHope’s website and information hub (NetHope Solutions Center), will be be pointed to in emails and social posts.

If desired or recommended by NetHope leadership, NetHope Crisis Informatics will publish it’s curated data and visuals on the Humanitarian Data Exchange.

### Feedback Loop
As these information products are distributed with NetHope’s organization and consortium, the NetHope Crisis Informatics team will receive feedback on what information is useful and identify where additional information is needed. NetHope Crisis Informatics will then repeat the cycle until the monitoring process is ready for slower information production tempo.

### List of Commonly-Used Data Sets for Initial Assessment

NetHope Crisis Informatics will commonly develop and/or utilize the following datasets in this phase of the information management cycle:

**Hydrography**: Identify bodies of water and their potential impacts on response efforts
Sample datasets: Current flooding extents, Levee/barrier breaches

**Weather**: Identify event related conditions that may influence response
Sample datasets: NOAA NWS weather trajectories

**Utilities**: Identifies impacted infrastructure that could be damaged or hazardous.
    Sample datasets: Power outages, phone (land-line) outages, and cell phone outages, damaged cell towers

**Transportation**: Identifies impacted access routes to the incident and other related transportation reference points.  
Sample datasets: Road closures, airport closures, rail & subway stoppages, bridge closures, ferry stoppages, and port closures

### List of Commonly-Used Data Sources:

NetHope Crisis Informatics will commonly utilize these data sources and repositories in this phase of the information management cycle:
