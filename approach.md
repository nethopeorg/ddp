# Approach

Interviews with stakeholders were semi-structured and attempted to address three primary questions with a focus on the first 72 hours after the onset of an emergency:

1. What is your role and what does it require you to do within the first 72 hours of a sudden onset emergency? 

2. What standard operating procedures do you follow and what are the key decision points (e.g. deploying assessment teams, making donor appeals, communications, etc). 

3. What data sets and information are most important for informing your work within these SOPs and at these decision points? 

A number of informal consultations were also held with stakeholders within and beyond the NetHope network, and additional insights from Phase I of the DDP project were also brought to bear, especially in refining NetHope’s understanding of decision maker needs during humanitarian response. The findings on key decision points and sources of data have been integrated in the development of our workflow.

Some additional and notable observations from these consultations are as follows:

* The vast majority of interviewees report that they do not adhere to standard operating procedures during the first hours of a response. For information managers, a range of templates and checklists are reported as being used, but respondents stress that every response is different and unique, and retaining an element of flexibility is paramount. Where SOPs do exist, they are generally employed as a reference or suggested guidance, and not operationalized in rigid form. 

* A common refrain is that even as increasing amounts and new sources of data become available and accessible in the earliest phases of disaster response, there remains a gap for decision makers at the highest levels to use this information. In part this is due to the self-conscious recognition that many early decisions are driven by the realities of politics and perception, and that press reporting - accurate or not - continues to have undue weight. Another reason for the gap is that organizations can lack the technical expertise and internal mechanisms to synthesize and simplify complex information, and provide key findings to busy senior managers. 

* In spite of this gap, organizations are continuing to make strides in integrating new sources of information, and implementing technical solutions to allow data to flow to and from the field. While the earliest decisions might still be made in a context of little or bad data, sophisticated analysis and information management is moving further and further upstream and up the chain of command.
