IFRC were semi-structured and attempted to address three primary questions with a focus on the first 72 hours after the onset of an emergency:

1. What is your role and what does it require you to do within the first 72 hours of a sudden onset emergency? 

2. What standard operating procedures do you follow and what are the key decision points (e.g. deploying assessment teams, making donor appeals, communications, etc). 

3. What data sets and information are most important for informing your work within these SOPs and at these decision points? 

A number of informal consultations were also held with stakeholders within and beyond the NetHope network, and additional insights from Phase I of the DDP project were also brought to bear, especially in refining NetHope’s understanding of decision maker needs during humanitarian response. The findings on key decision points and sources of data have been integrated in the development of our workflow.
