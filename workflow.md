# Workflow for Information Managers

Under UN General Assembly Resolution 46/182, “national authorities have the primary responsibility for taking care of victims of natural disasters and other emergencies that occur in their territory.” (IASC Cluster Reference Model 2015). When an emergency overwhelms national capacities, the hosting national authorities can request international assistance. International organizations and NGOs generally only respond to disasters when their aid is specifically requested.

To help scope the type of assets to be deployed, international organizations have used a three-step classification of disasters:

* **L1 Emergency**: any emergency in a country where a UN agency has a presence.
* **L2 Emergency**: any emergency which overwhelms in-country capacities and requires mobilization of regional support.
* **L3 Emergency**: either an emergency which overwhelms a specific UN agency’s regional capacity, or an emergency where the urgency, scale and complexity merit a UN system-wide response.

This work take several forms, each of which branches off into its own decision-making structures, workflows, and information needs.

* **Bilateral Agreements**: A hosting national authority may establish a relationship with another government, international agency, or NGO to provide specific services during a response operation. This may to send specific technical assistance (such as urban search and rescue, UNDAC teams, mortuary teams, telecommunications experts, etc) or it may to extend existing programming from one area of the contract into the affected areas.
* **Regional Disaster Management Agreements**: an association of national disaster management authorities that delegates specific functions to a regional disaster management authority. These include ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (aka, AHA Centre) and CDEMA. The capacity of these regional authorities has changed from a coordinating body to an operational capacity, as evidenced by the delegation of coordination and information management functions to ASEAN during the recent tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia. (links)
* **IASC Cluster System**: The Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) provides a framework for UN agencies, NGOs, government development agencies, and some private-sector companies to participate in a voluntary coordinating structure that is intended to integrate with host government procedures. The IASC cluster systems provides coordination across 12 areas: (diagram). (link)
* **Hybrids**: it is not rare to find a response operation where two (if not all three) structures are working in parallel. Some NGOs (including NetHope) may have a bilateral agreement with the government to provide specific aid while also coordinating with the IASC, the regional DMA, or both.

These structures share common elements, which are mapped out in this document.

## Developing Situational Awareness: Data Scramble

For a humanitarian organization, the minutes and hours following the onset of a disaster are characterized by a swirl of information gathering, with queries and exchanges that are both internal and external. In the context of information management, this phase is known as the ‘data scramble.’

In the case of weather events and other natural hazards for which there has been some element of advance warning, the data scramble begins well before a storm makes landfall or a wildfire reaches a populated place. In the ‘best case’ scenarios–often in geographies that experience hazards with regular frequency–much of the baseline information required to develop an initial high-level snapshot has already been identified and is readily accessible. But even in these cases, it is likely that some information will have to be updated, or that more granular data will need to be obtained or created to address the specific context of the event. While good data preparedness may reduce the complexity of the data scramble phase, it will never obviate it.

Every event is unique. A natural hazard occurs in a complex web of dynamics.

Data are rarely in a form that we would like. As the World Bank describes in the Open Data for Resilience Field Guide,

*"Data describe a dynamic reality. Cities are growing at extraordinary rates, with formal and informal settlements sprouting up faster than cartographers can build maps. Alongside this rapid urbanization, hazards are changing in ways that make it far less likely that historical understandings will inform prudent decisions about probable futures. Climate change is altering weather patterns and bringing extreme weather to places that have never seen such variation. Existing stocks of data about
a nation’s infrastructure and its relation to natural hazards each need to updated more frequently and at higher resolutions than ever before. In a time of economic hardship and unequal globalization, few governments possess the resources to collate existing data, collect new data, and feed them all into an ecosystem of analysts who can make sense of them so that practitioners can design and implement projects that get ahead of the disaster cycle."*

context where a society may be An earthquake the occurs in summer may require affected people to stay outdoors for one or more nights as shelters come online. That same event in the middle of winter may require urgent temporary shelter solution. That said, many disasters below are some of the most common elements of information that are assembled in the very early phases of a response:

### Magnitude
There are various scales employed in order to assess the magnitude of different kinds of natural hazards, for example Richter scale for earthquake, or the Saffir-Simpson wind scale for hurricanes. These measures take on more meaning in the humanitarian context when combined with elements of human exposure and risk.

### Extent
What is the overall area impacted by an event? In the case of a natural hazard, the initial focus is on areas of human settlement where damage and casualities have been sustained. But the area of impact may also include shipping or flight routes that are affected. Displacement within or outside of a country may also result from a large scale natural hazard, and more commonly from conflict or civil unrest.

### Affected Population
How many people are likely to have been affected, how vulnerable are these people are to the natural hazard, where they are likely to have moved to and from?

### Secondary Events
What is the probability of additional hazards, including tsunamis resulting from an earthquake, flooding due to storm surges, or mudslides due to prolonged rain?

### Status of Critical Infrastructure
What is the status of airports, seaports, rail stations and lines, and roads? Are key government or other service facilities open and operating?

### Power and Communications
What is the status of power and communications, where are the outages, and how many people are affected?

### 3W (Who is doing What, Where?)
Which organizations are already working in the country, which are deploying staff to the country, what are they doing, and what they intend to do?

## 1 Damage Assessment

In this phase of the information management cycle, NetHope Crisis Informatics utilizes the data gathered from the previous phases to determine where a disaster’s impact has been greatest. The analysis conducted in this phase is crucial as it can determine whether NetHope (1.) continues the monitoring process or (2.) begins internal processes for a deployment.

The process the Crisis Informatics team uses is as follows:

### 1. Curating information from the data scramble
To begin, NetHope Crisis Informatics will start by curating information already gathered from the data scramble and keep only for information that speaks to a disaster’s impact on infrastructure or people. This means excluding current weather conditions, socio-economic data, and the like. If the damage to an area has been severe enough, NetHope Crisis Informatics will use this information at a later time, likely in the Needs Assessment phase.

This part of the process is usually completed within a few minutes. Useful information will be sent to the NetHope Crisis Team technical staff for analysis and visual, described in the steps below.

### 2. Seeking new information sources
Even as NetHope Crisis Informatics begins damage assessment analysis, conditions are likely to have worsened in an impacted community since the initial data scramble. If this is likely to have been the case, the Crisis Informatics team will conduct a refresh of all previous data pulls and seek additional information sources that confirm or reject news about what conditions are on the ground. This often means a deeper dive into international platforms that have the most-up-to-date information on disaster events, such as: Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team,  UN OCHA’s Virtual On-Site Operations Coordination Center, and the Global Disaster Alerting Coordination System, and ReliefWeb.

In this step of the process, NetHope Crisis Informatics will often turn to its tech partners, such as Facebook, Google, DigitalGlobe, and GSMA and inquire what their sensors are picking up around an impacted region. This will be done by way of email, phone call, Slack channels, and/or accessing an data sharing portals they may have.
All of the information that is gathered is stored on a Box folder, with specific insights shared informally with NetHope Director of Information Management and Crisis Informatics. The stored data  will later be turned into visuals and infographics for internal and external distribution.

### 3. Liaise with members and international partners who are deploying
The NetHope Crisis Informatics team will also reach out to NGO members who have offices and programs in an impacted region and request their internal situation awareness reports to enhance our own understanding. This is done by NetHope Crisis Informatics liaising with NetHope Member Engagement to:
Identify emergency managers at our member organizations

* Retrieve their contact information
* Draft and send either a group or individual emails to request their situation reports

If a disaster have been severe enough, NetHope will bypass individual email requests and will coordinate a member-only call, where all of the NGOs in our network will participate and share their updates live. These calls may be a one-off event or set to a specific schedule (i.e. daily, bi-weekly, etc.) if it’s helpful to everyone involved. These calls not only support the sharing of situational awareness, but often times it can lead to NetHope NGO members sharing aid resources and coordinating their emergency responses efforts together.

NetHope Crisis Informatics will engage the the World Food Programme or the greater United Nations Emergency Telecommunications Cluster to ascertain what the Cluster knows about a developing emergency and who may be deploying or pre-deploying.

### 4. Developing products for the SLT, emergency response team
Once all of this information is gathered and catalogued on Box, NetHope Crisis Informatics will then turn this information in visual and informational products that can support and inform decision making throughout the organization and consortium. These products include:

**Situation Reports (Sitreps)**: An e-newsletter that is sent to either the entire consortium of NetHope NGO members and tech partners, or just the NetHope NGO members in the disaster impacted country. Sections of the e-newsletter include:

**Summary of the Situation**: A brief overview of the size and scope of the disaster

**Telecommunication and Power Updates**: Insights from GSMA, UN ETC, and news media on the degradation of power and telecommunications infrastructure

**NetHope Members**: A list of NetHope NGO members with offices in the country and what their planned/actual response activity for the disaster are.

**Maps and Visuals**: Curation of maps and visuals developed within NetHope or gathered from external information sources

**Maps and Infographics**: Charts, graphics, and map aids that summarize insights from data will be developed and later compiled into a digital visual book. That book is then emailed to NetHope’s operational team and made available the NetHope’s team for use on other digital platforms.

**Social Media Bursts**: Sample post text and images will be emailed to the NetHope Comms team to share information on our social channels (such as Twitter and NetHope)

**NetHope and Solution Center Website Updates**: Copy and visuals will again be emailed to the NetHope Comms team to publish on NetHope’s website and information hub (NetHope Solutions Center), will be be pointed to in emails and social posts

If desired or recommended by NetHope leadership, NetHope Crisis Informatics will publish it’s curated data and visuals on the Humanitarian Data Exchange.

### 5. Requesting feedback to start the process again
As these information products are distributed with NetHope’s organization and consortium, the NetHope Crisis Informatics team will receive feedback on what information is useful and where further clarification is needed. NetHope Crisis Informatics will then repeat the data curation - visualization - distribution cycle until the monitoring process is complete or the NetHope emergency response team is on the ground, if they have been deployed.


### List of Commonly-Used Data Sets for Damage Assessment:

NetHope Crisis Informatics will commonly develop and/or utilize the following datasets in this phase of the information management cycle:

**Hydrography**: Identify bodies of water and their potential impacts on response efforts

**Transportation**: Identifies impacted access routes to the incident and other related transportation reference points.  
Sample datasets: Road closures, airport closures, rail & subway stoppages, bridge closures, ferry stoppages, and port closures

### List of Commonly-Used Data Sources:

NetHope Crisis Informatics will commonly utilize these data sources and repositories in this phase of the information management cycle:

**Satellite imagery providers**: Planet, DigitalGlobe, Esri
**UN Agencies**: UN OCHA, UNOSAT,  WFP, Emergency Telecommunications Cluster

## Mobilization
In near parallel to the data scramble phase, and sometimes before a formal decision to deploy is made, the pre-deployment process of mobilization begins. Logistical and travel arrangements must be made. Staff who are likely to deploy begin to pack and determine what technical equipment can be taken with them. Pro forma invoices and other documents are produced in order to expedite passage through customs, and to allow for transfer to partners on the ground, if necessary. NetHope staff also require an organizational sponsor – usually a partner NGO – in order to obtain the proper visas and permission to operate in a foreign country. Staff also need to establish who their initial points of contact will be on the ground.


---

## Deployment
A disaster of sufficient magnitude and humanitarian impact, with a request for assistance from a NetHope partner, will result in the deployment of a small contingent from NetHope’s Emergency Response Team. These staff carry out a two-fold mission: conducting needs assessments through consultations with government, partner NGOs, and affected communities; and providing NetHope’s core competency by improving connectivity in any way possible. To this end the initial deployment team brings as much equipment with them as is practicable, in order to address any urgent communications needs identified by in-country stakeholders.

Needs assessments are carried out as outlined in the below section, in concert with remote assessments by the Crisis Informatics team. Even while working to improve connectivity and create a facilitating environment for response by all agencies, NetHope staff must be prepared to conduct their initial data gathering with little or no connectivity and no access to online tools. The basic elements of information management, including the cleaning of field data, are often carried out on the fly. For example, lists of sites that require connectivity will flow in from numerous different agencies and it is rare that a standard format for this information will be applied. Locations may be vaguely defined, and the names and spellings of place names may be inconsistent and difficult to reconcile. If they are provided, geographic coordinates may be incorrect or inaccurate, or provided in different formats or coordinate systems.

Sound information management practices must also be applied to track the inventory of equipment that is distributed, the terms and intended duration of its deployment, and responsible points of contact. Ongoing monitoring is required to ensure that equipment and relevant services continue to function properly.

## Needs Assessment

After conducting a damage assessment, the NetHope Crisis Informatics team will work closely with the deployed NetHope Emergency Response Team to conduct an in-depth needs assessment. Needs assessments are used to pinpoint where NetHope should focus its operations.

These can be conducted in two scenarios:

**Remotely**: Where the Crisis Informatics team will hyper focus its information products on the impacted population, gathering data from open repositories and on-site entities NetHope has relationships with.
**In the field**: Where the NetHope Emergency Response Team will deploy several team members to the impacted country. Team members will survey the government, humanitarian organizations, and impacted communities on where

From a remote distance, NetHope Crisis Informatics will look to gather information from data sources that provide both historical (pre-crisis) and current (in-crisis) information. Historical data can provide context on existing patterns of population needs, such as: population and other demographic baselines, nutrition surveys, quality of health or education facilities, and infrastructure surveys. Just as in the damage assessment phase, information can come from a wide variety of  sources for needs assessments: including such as media reports, social media, personal reports from key informants who have visited or live in the area, aerial imagery for infrastructure damage (e.g. provided by UNOSAT, NDMA, or crowdsourcing), and formal situation reports from government entities or international agencies. Initial

Gathering information remotely, which can also be referred to as “secondary data” is crucial for humanitarian needs assessments and forms the foundation for all decision making. Secondary data inform what kind of primary data, that which is directly collected in the field, should be gathered. It is especially important due to the usual resource constraints, either financial and logistical, that limit the collection of new primary data.

If NetHope deploys an assessment team to a country, that assessment team - often staffed by NetHope Emergency Response - will survey local partners to understand what kind of connectivity aid is needed and where. This information is collected on an Excel spreadsheet and stored on Box. NetHope Crisis Informatics will then take the Box file and create visual dashboards for NetHope leadership and Emergency Response to view and interact with. Depending on the severity of the disaster and the potential for launching a full-on response effort, NetHope may also share visuals with donors, so they may also get an understanding of what’s happening on the ground and what the need is for connectivity support.

In the survey, the assessment team will gather the following information:

<table>
<tr><td>NetHope ID:</td><td>Assigned number the assessment team has given to a connectivity site</td></tr>
<tr><td>City:</td><td>Name of the city or town the survey is being conducted in</td></tr>
<tr><td>Country:</td><td>Name of the country the survey</td></tr>
<tr><td>Coordinates:</td><td>Latitude and longitude, recorded in decimal form</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total population:</td><td>Count of persons in the town, city or shelter</td></tr>
<tr><td>Date of survey:</td><td>When the survey was conducted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Member NGO presence:</td><td>Describes which, if any, NetHope members would access connectivity through the site</td></tr>
<tr><td>Status:</td><td>Whether that particular connectivity site is actively providing connectivity or has been closed</td></tr>
<tr><td>Connection type:</td><td>The type of device that has been setup. Example: LTE, VSAT, or P2P</td></tr>
<tr><td>Date operational:</td><td>A record of when the device went live and connectivity became available for intended users (i.e. the public or the local government building)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Internet provider:</td><td>Which mobile network operator is providing service on the device</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bandwidth:</td><td>Maximum amount of data that can transferred at any given time on the device</td></tr>
<tr><td>Team:</td><td>The letter of the NetHope emergency response team that collected the information. (Example: Team A)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Comments:</td><td>Any additional notes the assessment team wants to record, but doesn’t belong in the previous data fields</td></tr>
</table>

NetHope Crisis Informatics is currently developing a mobile form version of the assessment survey, so (1.) future assessments teams can conduct surveys more efficiently (2.) NetHope Crisis Informatics can automate the visualization process. The collective goal is to see and share the information assessment teams are collecting in real-time.

## Appeals

One of the primary sources of data on humanitarian funding, the Financial Tracking Service (FTS), is managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The FTS was established in 1992, but in recent years has made significant progress in applying standard methodologies and data structures, with a updated platform release in 2017. The service is not and never will be a comprehensive digest of all humanitarian funding - even for the highest profile events - but it is a very useful resource in tracking the funding from donors to local humanitarian actors, and in comparing the scopes and degrees of response to consolidated humanitarian appeals. The FTS is particularly useful in tracking data voluntarily submitted by government donors, UN-administered funds, UN agencies, NGOs, and increasingly the private sector.
