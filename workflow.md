Under UN General Assembly Resolution 46/182, “national authorities have the primary responsibility for taking care of victims of natural disasters and other emergencies that occur in their territory.” (IASC Cluster Reference Model 2015). When an emergency overwhelms national capacities, the hosting national authorities can request international assistance. International organizations and NGOs generally only respond to disasters when their aid is specifically requested.
To help scope the type of assets to be deployed, international organizations have used a three-step classification of disasters:

* **L1 Emergency**: any emergency in a country where a UN agency has a presence.
* **L2 Emergency**: any emergency which overwhelms in-country capacities and requires mobilization of regional support.
* **L3 Emergency**: either an emergency which overwhelms a specific UN agency’s regional capacity, or an emergency where the urgency, scale and complexity merit a UN system-wide response.

This work take several forms, each of which branches off into its own decision-making structures, workflows, and information needs.

* **Bilateral Agreements**: A hosting national authority may establish a relationship with another government, international agency, or NGO to provide specific services during a response operation. This may to send specific technical assistance (such as urban search and rescue, UNDAC teams, mortuary teams, telecommunications experts, etc) or it may to extend existing programming from one area of the contract into the affected areas.
* **Regional Disaster Management Agreements**: an association of national disaster management authorities that delegates specific functions to a regional disaster management authority. These include ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (aka, AHA Centre) and CDEMA. The capacity of these regional authorities has changed from a coordinating body to an operational capacity, as evidenced by the delegation of coordination and information management functions to ASEAN during the recent tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia.

* **IASC Cluster System**: The Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) provides a framework for UN agencies, NGOs, government development agencies, and some private-sector companies to participate in a voluntary coordinating structure that is intended to integrate with host government procedures. The IASC cluster systems provides coordination across 12 areas: (diagram). (link)
* **Hybrids**: it is not rare to find a response operation where two (if not all three) structures are working in parallel. Some NGOs (including NetHope) may have a bilateral agreement with the government to provide specific aid while also coordinating with the IASC, the regional DMA, or both.

These structures share common elements, which are mapped out in this document.Add more here or delete line?

##Developing Situational Awareness: Data Scramble

For a humanitarian organization, the minutes and hours following the onset of a disaster are characterized by a swirl of information gathering, with queries and exchanges that are both internal and external. In the context of information management, this phase is known as the ‘data scramble.’

In the case of weather events and other natural hazards for which there has been some element of advance warning, the data scramble begins well before a storm makes landfall, for example, or a wildfire reaches a populated place. In the ‘best case’ scenarios – often in geographies that experience hazards with regular frequency – much of the baseline information required to develop an initial high-level snapshot has already been identified and is readily accessible. But even in these cases, it is likely that some information will have to be updated, or that more granular data will need to be obtained or created to address the specific context of the event. The best data preparedness may reduce the complexity of the data scramble phase, but will never obviate it.

Though every event is unique, below are some of the most common elements of information that are assembled in the very early phases of a response:

###Magnitude
There are various scales employed in order to assess the magnitude of different kinds of natural hazards, for example Richter scale for earthquake, or the Saffir-Simpson wind scale for hurricanes. These measures take on more meaning in the humanitarian context when combined with elements of human exposure and risk.

###Extent
What is the overall area impacted by an event? In the case of a natural hazard, the initial focus is on areas of human settlement where damage and casualities have been sustained. But the area of impact may also include shipping or flight routes that are affected. Displacement within or outside of a country may also result from a large scale natural hazard, and more commonly from conflict or civil unrest.

###Affected Population
How many people are likely to have been affected, how vulnerable are these people are to the natural hazard, where they are likely to have moved to and from?

###Secondary Events
What is the probability of additional hazards, including tsunamis resulting from an earthquake, flooding due to storm surges, or mudslides due to prolonged rain?

###Status of Critical Infrastructure
What is the status of airports, seaports, rail stations and lines, and roads? Are key government or other service facilities open and operating?

###Power and Communications
What is the status of power and communications, where are the outages, and how many people are affected?

###3W (Who is doing What, Where?)
Which organizations are already working in the country, which are deploying staff to the country, what are they doing, and what they intend to do?

###List of Data Sets###:
(add link to data on website when ready - need to format lists in below sections consistently and reduce redundancy)

NetHope Crisis Informatics will commonly develop and/or utilize the following datasets in this phase of the information management cycle:

###Hydrography
Identify bodies of water and their potential impacts on response efforts

*Sample datasets*: National flood hazard or flood zones, Historic flood boundaries, Levee/barrier locations, Tide charts, River levels (current & forecasted), Current flooding extents, Levee/barrier breaches

###Weather
Identify event related conditions that may influence response
Sample datasets: NOAA NWS forecasts, River/stream gauges, Atmospheric conditions (wind direction, etc.)

###Utilities
Identify infrastructure that could be damaged or hazardous.
Sample datasets: Utility pipelines, power lines, power plants, cell towers, radio communication, main Internet hubs/lines, telephone (land line) facilities & lines, power outages, phone (land line) outages, cell phone outages

###Transportation
Identify access routes to the incident and other related transportation reference points.  
Sample datasets: Roads, evacuation routes (including contra-flow routing), bridges and tunnels, railway lines and stations, subway lines and stations, ferry lines and terminals, navigable waterways, boat ramps, maritime infrastructure (vessel mooring areas, marinas, boat ramps, ports, docks), airports, helicopter landing zones, road closures, airport closures, rail & subway stoppages, bridge closures, ferry stoppages, port closures, active evacuation routes (including contra-flow routing)

###Population
Identify impacted and at-risk populations.
Sample datasets: Population density, socio-economic data (income, gender, age etc.), nighttime population vs. daytime population, seasonal population, businesses, at-need population (schools, day care, nursing homes, assisted care facilities, universities, hospitals/clinics, urgent care, mental health and correctional facilities, etc.)

###Public Safety
Identify public safety and incident command facilities
Sample datasets: Fire stations, police stations EOCs (local, State, national), Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs)/911 Call Centers, shelters, evacuation zones
